        <h1>Van Jacobson and TCP/IP</h1>

        <h2>Van Jacobson's Primary Contributions</h2>
        <p>
            Aside from Van Jacobson's seminal developments on TCP/IP which reduced internet congestion in time for the major traffic surge of the late 1980's, 
            Jacobson has co-written a variety of tools that are equally relevant today.
        </p>
        <p>
            This includes network diagnostic tools such as tcpdump, traceroute, and pathchar; as well as the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBone). 
            He also laid the foundation for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications with audio and video conferencing tools vic, vat, and wb.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jacobson's algorithm for congestion wasn't just a method for speeding up Internet use for existing users, however. Firstly, this compression 
            algorithm made the Internet more accessible for users with lower-end hardware and connections. Perhaps more important, though, is the 
            lasting impact of this implementation.
