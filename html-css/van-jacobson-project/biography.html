        <h1>Van Jacobson and TCP/IP</h1>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
            Save for the fact that Van Jacobson was born circa 1950 and his interest in high school physics, very little has been made public about his life pre-university.
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
            Jacobson engaged in graduate work at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as he finished his computer science doctorate.<br>
            He credits his unique deductive reasoning to his time spent working on control software for linear accelerators. Through this, he claims<br>
            to have learned how to ask the right questions.
        </p>

        <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
        <p>
            By October 1986, after an extensive break from computer science and physics, Jacobson decided to get back to work.<br>
            Working closely with Mike Karels to develop Slow-Start, the Berkeley Unix developers attempted to solve the Internet's congestion gridlock, which<br>
            had reduced traffic speeds from ~56K bit/sec to ~320 bit/sec. He spent nearly six months trying to figure out how to reduce congestion before<br>
            falling back on his physicist methodology: asking the right question would reveal the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than asking himself how he could make <i>this</i> work, he thought, <b>"How was the internet ever able to work in the first place?"</b>
            A solution quickly fell into place as he asserted that the Internet's standard technique of retransmitting information until it finally went through<br>
            was to blame for the severe congestion. Overcoming this obstacle was simply a matter of engineering a little "politeness" into the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>Van Jacobson Technique</b> (Slow-Start) delayed the sending of packets from one device by a few milliseconds until the network was clear of packets<br>
            which were already in transit. This technique was first built into Berkeley Unix servers in 1987, but it is also largely to thank for the modern internet's<br>
            congestion-free state. Interestingly, the number of users was ~10,000 at that time. As of 2024, there are ~5.44 billion internet users worldwide.
