# The Van Jacobson Website Project

This is a CSC 452A summer project in which I must demonstrate my understanding of fundamental HTML and CSS.

The instructions were as follows:

1. **Research:** Choose one key founder of the Internet (e.g., Vint Cerf, Bob Kahn, Paul Baran, Larry Roberts, Leonard Kleinrock, or others you discover in your research). Conduct thorough research on their background, contributions, and the significance of their work.

3. **Website Development:** The required web page elements are:
   - **Home Page (Landing Page)**
     - Title: Include the founder’s name and a brief description.
     - Navigation Menu: Links to other sections of the website (e.g., Biography, Contributions, Impact, Gallery, References).
     - Introduction: A brief introduction to the founder and their role in the development of the Internet.
   - **Biography Page**
     - Detailed background information about the founder.
     - Include their early life, education, and career highlights.
   - **Contributions Page**
     - Detailed description of their specific contributions to the development of the Internet.
     - Explain the technologies, theories, or innovations they developed, such as packet-switching, TCP/IP protocols, or the ARPANET.
   - **Impact Page**
     - Analysis of how their work has impacted the development of the Internet.
     - Discuss both historical significance and modern-day relevance.
   - **Gallery Page**
     - Collection of images and multimedia related to the founder’s work and life.
     - Include captions and brief descriptions for each item.
   - **References Page**
     - List of all sources used for research. Include citations for images and videos. The sources must be original.
     - Ensure all sources are cited properly using a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA).

4. **Technical Requirements:** The website should be created using HTML only, or HTML and CSS depending on your confidence level after two weeks of web design.
   Do not use any commercial apps to create your websites. It will contain HTML and CSS that I will be able to tell you did not create.
   Use a simple IDE or a text editor such as Notepad++. At this stage of the course, the website does not have to be responsive,
   but the website should include elements to make it web accessible. Ensure all links are functional and the website is easy to navigate.
