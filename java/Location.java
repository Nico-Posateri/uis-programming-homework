/*
A program that prompts the user to enter a two-dimensional array and displays the location of
the largest element in the array by the following instructions:

1) Design a class named Location for locating a maximal value and its location in a two-dimensional array,
containing a public data field maxValue storing the maximal value as a double type and a public data fields row and column
storing the indices in a two-dimensional array as int types.

2) Write a method named locateLargest for returning the location of the largest element in a two-dimensional array.
Note that the return value is an instance of Location.
